This project is about server farm assembly for running whirlpool on a on-demand hardware resources offered by AWS. The figures use altitude analogy to illustrate incremental changes to the infrastructure between 5000 ft. and 10,000 ft. The AWS resources are provisioned using AWS cloudformation tool published in template `whirlpool-cf-template.yml`.
